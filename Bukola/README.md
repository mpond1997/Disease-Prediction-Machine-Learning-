# Project 4 - Disease Prediction

## Project Overview:
This project involved two major tasks: data preprocessing and visualization using Tableau. The objective was to analyze trends related to diabetes and its associated factors.

## Data Preprocessing:
In the data preprocessing phase, we transformed the raw data into categorical format to facilitate analysis. This involved writing code to convert numerical data into categorical variables, such as categorizing diabetes status, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other health indicators.

## Tableau Visualization:
The Tableau visualization component of the project focused on uncovering insights from the preprocessed data. This was achieved through interactive dashboards that allowed users to explore various trends related to diabetes prevalence, health indicators, and lifestyle factors.

## Dashboard Insights:
- Relationship between diabetes prevalence and high blood pressure
- Impact of physical activity on stroke risk among diabetic/prediabetic individuals
- Diabetes prevalence among individuals with high cholesterol

## How to Use:
1. Access the Tableau dashboard using the provided link.
2. Interact with the charts and filters to explore different trends.
3. Use gender and age-group filters to further analyze the data.

## Conclusion:
This project provides valuable insights into the relationship between diabetes and various health indicators, lifestyle factors, and demographic characteristics. The interactive Tableau dashboard offers a user-friendly platform for exploring and understanding the data.
